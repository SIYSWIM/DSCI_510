    "\n",
    "- You must complete the assignments individually. If you have trouble completing the assignment, please let one of the teaching assistants (TAs) know, during the lab or their office hours. They will help and guide you, but they will not write code for you and no one else should :) !!!  \n",
    "\n",
    "- You have to fill in the code in this notebook and upload it back to Blackboard for submission. Please remember to rename your file as \"Lab4_[YOUR FIRSTNAME]_[YOUR LASTNAME].ipynb\" (e.g. Lab4_George_Washington.ipynb).\n",
